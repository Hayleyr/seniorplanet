/ Public Computer Center Description":"EQUIPMENT: Problems with some of the computers.  As you walk through the door, the computer immediately to your right has a very advanced version of Windows and was difficult for me to work with and I never had a student that could handle it, so we did not use that station.  There is a computer station with an extremely large screen, the touch screen, which can also be used with a mouse and Alvin said it can be used for a class.  You might want to try it.  It was kinda hard to work with as I remember.  I think it was hard to select something.  That will give you 8 stations (minus the one with the advanced Windows version).         DRY ERASE BOARD: The office uses the dry erase board to state that the office is closed for lunch until 1pm.  But they would let me take it at @ 12:50.  They have erasers but you might want to bring your own markers.  It is very awkward to carry and I would take it out through Stephanie Rice\u2019s office (the program director) which is the quickest way to the computer room door.  Then you take the board back to the office.  It is stored behind Julia Schwartz-Leeper\u2019s door, the executive director, across from Betty\u2019s desk.  Also be careful nobody trips over the legs as the computer space is, of course, very tight.  I try to spread the legs out as far as I can in the tight space to prevent it from falling over.      TEMPERATURE: In general it is good to have the overhead fan going all the time.  On the really hot days, ventilation was much better with the doors open if the noise would allow it.  There is a standing a/c unit in there and Alvin can show you how to use it.  You have to reset it with a button near where it plugs into the wall.    SIGN-IN SHEETS: Rob told me to use the senior center\u2019s sign in sheets.  The people in the office will show you where they keep them.  I just had someone in the office photocopy them at the end of the courses and gave the originals to Stephanie.        LEAVING THE CENTER: At the end of the class, I would go around the make sure off the computers and wireless mice and the one wireless keyboard was turned off.  The monitors along the wall that has the door remain on.  The other monitors should be turned off.        LUNCH: The center serves lunch from 12 to 1 for 2.50.  Alvin is always there and would be glad to sit with you.        GENERAL INFO: The center has a web site http://www.riverdalesenior.org/ . I am not sure of the facebook page web address.  You will have to ask Stephanie.  ALVIN: Alvin is available to help students out with problems.  He is also available to make an appointment to help students in their homes with their computers for a donation to the senior center.  Also if I ran into a problem like the internet not connecting, he is nearly always there and will drop whatever and come to help.","Phone Number":"718-884-5900","Classroom Location":"","Community Board":8,"Visual Aid":"moveable white board","# of Student Workstations":10,"Title":"Program Coordinator","Street Address":"2600 Netherland Avenue","City":"Bronx","Council District":11,"Site Code":"RIV","Phone Number for Public":"718-884-5900 x14","Email":"msilva@riverdalesenior.org","State":"NY","Congressional Districts":17,"geo_latitude":40.8787539},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.9144368909605,40.8787539]}},{"id":"Samuel Field Y","properties":{"PCC":"","Assembly District":26,"Main Site Contact Person":"Ilene Yair","Lab Description Date":"","Additional Contact Person":"Karen Schwab","Additional Contact Person Number":"718-225-6750 Ext. 256","Additional Contact Person Title":"Director, Older Adult Services","# of Trainer Workstations":"","Additional Contact Person Email":"kschwab@sfy.org","Fax Number":"","geo_accuracy":"house","Zip Code":"11362","geo_longitude":-73.7232714887706,"Sponsor":"","Senate District":11,"General Site Notes":"","Site":"Samuel Field Y","Computer Lab / Public Computer Center Description":"","Phone Number":"718-225-6750 ext. 236","Classroom Location":"","Community Board":11,"Visual Aid":"","# of Student Workstations":13,"Title":"Adult Center Director","Street Address":"58-20 Little Neck Parkway","City":"Little Neck","Council District":23,"Site Code":"SFY","Phone Number for Public":"","Email":"ileneyair@sfy.org ","State":"NY","Congressional Districts":5,"geo_latitude":40.76081275},"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.7232714887706,40.76081275]}},{"id":"Samuel J.
